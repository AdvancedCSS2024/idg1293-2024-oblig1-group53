## Overview

We initiated our project by sketching the different components found in our version of the two provided screenshots.

## `page-screenshot1.html` - Work by Kristoffer

Kristoffer began with the layout for "page-screenshot1.html", starting from the top and working downwards, ensuring to commit and synchronize changes regularly despite challenges encountered due to working on separate computers. The process involved:

- Copying SVG code directly from FINN's site for grid items.
- Implementing a feature where icons change color from blue to gray upon hovering, which posed a significant challenge but was eventually realized with varying success across different icons.
- Developing card layouts, facing particular difficulty with the placement of a "heart" button in the top right corner but overcoming these with a focused approach.

## page-screenshot2.html-Sander 
Sander started by first mapping out the layout for the example page, then started working with html and css layout. I then started by making the different input elements and through trial and error managed to achieve
The same layout from the example page. 

## Demo page
At the end we created the demo.html page to provide insight
Into how we made the different components to our websites. This was a great exercise to practice teamwork when it comes to developing.
